IN THIS GAME YOU ROLL 4 BALLS SUCCESSIVELY AT A TARGET
BALL (CALLED A JACK). THE OBJECT IS TO GET THE BALLS AS CLOSE
TO THE JACK AS POSSIBLE. THE BALLS ARE 10 CM IN DIAMETER AND
ARE WEIGHTED SO THAT THEY ROLL IN A CURVE. YOU WILL HAVE TO
ROLL THEM AT AN ANGLE TO THE LINE FROM YOU AT COORDINATES 0,0
TO THE JACK AT COORDINATES X,Y. A POSITIVE ANGLE WILL MAKE
THE BALL CURVE CLOCKWISE. A NEGATIVE ANGLE WILL  MAKE IT CURVE
ANTI-CLOCKWISE. THE JACK IS A 4 CM WIDE AND WILL ROLL
STRAIGHT IF YOU HIT IT. BALLS HIT BY YOUR THROWN BALL MAY
CURVE IN EITHER DIRECTION.

HINT. TRY AN INITIAL VELOCITY OF 500 AND AN ANGLE OF 10
